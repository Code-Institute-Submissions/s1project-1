Stream 1 project
This project was inspired by a trip i did in the past.

It allows the users that may be interested in an overland adventure view the places i had visited and travelled to and how to do it.

This was my first web page so i wanted to include what i felt was most necessary to those interested in the adventure.

I added a booking form to allow users to book an available overland vehicle and a route they would like to take.

I also added a section outlining other overland adventure routes that friends and family of mine have undergone.
